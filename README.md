🐉 Edona Mema — Cybersecurity Portfolio
🌿 About Me

I’m Edona Mema, an aspiring cybersecurity professional passionate about Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Identity & Access Management (IAM).
My journey began in data analysis and compliance operations, evolving into cloud security and hands-on defense projects using AWS and open-source tools.
I thrive on bridging the gap between technical controls and policy frameworks — translating security principles into actionable compliance documentation.
Currently, I’m pursuing the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification and completing the Innovation Fellowship in Cybersecurity at The Knowledge House (TKH).

⚙️ Cybersecurity Journey

My transition into cybersecurity began with building a virtualized home lab to simulate enterprise systems and access control scenarios.
From there, I expanded into cloud projects focused on AWS security architecture, SIEM integration (Wazuh), and network defense.
Each project deepened my understanding of how governance frameworks (NIST, CIS Controls, OWASP) connect to technical implementations like IAM, encryption, and incident response.

Key Milestones:

🔐 Built a Cybersecurity Home Lab with pfSense, Snort, and Windows/Linux nodes

☁️ Gained AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and deployed multi-region architectures

🧩 Joined national-level CTF competitions and collaborated on team-based AWS security builds

🧾 Documented projects using APA-style technical reports, network diagrams, and risk assessments

💻 Projects Overview
🧱 Cybersecurity Home Lab Environment (2024–2025)

Built a fully virtualized cybersecurity lab using VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu to simulate IAM and SOC operations.

Configured pfSense firewalls and Snort IDS for traffic inspection

Applied RBAC and Active Directory concepts for identity management

Practiced vulnerability scanning and incident response documentation

🧠 Bloomberg Hackathon Cybersecurity CTF (2025)

Participated in a national-level cybersecurity Capture-the-Flag event hosted by Bloomberg.

Completed 15+ challenges in cryptography, web exploitation, and reverse engineering

Applied OSINT, packet capture, and forensics for simulated incident response

Delivered a post-event GRC report mapping risks and mitigations

🌍 AWS VPC Peering Connection — Team Project (2025)

Collaborated on a group project to establish secure cross-region connectivity between AWS VPCs.

Designed multi-region VPCs (us-east-1 and us-east-2) using Terraform and AWS CLI

Configured VPC Peering Connections, route tables, and IAM policies

Validated connectivity using VPC Reachability Analyzer and CloudTrail logs

Created a network topology diagram and documented findings for cloud security best practices
