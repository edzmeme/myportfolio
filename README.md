ðŸ§¾ README Projects Summary Paragraph

My portfolio highlights hands-on cybersecurity and cloud engineering projects focused on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and secure cloud architecture. I designed a fully virtualized Cybersecurity Home Lab using VirtualBox, pfSense, and Snort to simulate real-world incident response and IAM environments. As part of the Bloomberg Cybersecurity Hackathon, I completed 15+ Capture-the-Flag challenges covering cryptography, web exploitation, and forensic analysis while documenting mitigation strategies aligned with GRC frameworks. Most recently, I collaborated on an AWS VPC Peering Connection Group Project, where I configured cross-region network connectivity between two isolated VPCs, validated private routing paths using VPC Reachability Analyzer, and implemented IAM policies to secure resource communication. These projects showcase my ability to build, document, and defend secure systems using both open-source and AWS-native tools.
